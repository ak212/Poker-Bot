# Poker-Bot

# To Do:
* hand evaluation - most valuable hand created from 5 of the (up to) 7 cards available
* keep track of how many people in the hand - part of Dealer?
* fold - subtract them from number of people in the hand
* boolean value on player for in hand
* if num people = 1 and the player is still in the hand, they win
* ante, dealer button, big blind, small blind
* know when someone is all in - create side pot if two or more other players in the hand

# Ideas:
* possibly configuration/settings file for blind amounts, starting amounts, how many hands between upping the blinds
